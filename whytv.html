			<h3> Efficiency</h3>
			<p>TV advertising is no longer a process of buying advertising space in bulk as part of share agreements at a fixed rate. Now, with the rise of independent TV planning agencies, TV can be a highly efficient, targeted medium. We perform preliminary sector and competitor analysis to identify channels, times of the day, days of week and programming that delivers your target audience at low costs. We’ll continue to monitor your campaign throughout its run, ensuring its effect remains in line with your needs.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Engagement</h3>
			<p>TV advertising engages more people, and at a deeper level, than any other media. TV increases branded search online by an average of 35%, whilst 51% of all advertising-related word-of-mouth derives from the small screen.  The fact is, TV advertising works extremely well as a direct response mechanism – with 57% of all UK adults claiming to have researched a brand, product or service in reaction to seeing a TV ad.</p>

			<h3>Reach</h3>
			<p>When it comes to scale and reach, TV advertising is a monster. According to Thinkbox 73% of the UK population is reached in one week through TV, indeed, we’re all lovestruck when it comes to our relationship with the box; consuming an average of 2 hours 25 minutes of commercial TV a day and 45 ads. Yet, with this reach comes flexibility; if engaging the entire country doesn’t correlate with your business model, then there several regional TV advertising platforms that cater for specific geographical and lifestyle targeting.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accountable</h3>
			<p>As previously stated, TV advertising is now a fully accountable medium. Each individual TV spot within your campaign can be linked to live web data, facilitating the measurement of cost per sales, response and acquisition with unprecedented depth and accuracy. If sections of your strategy are underperforming, we use analysis to address them immediately!</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Integration</h3>
			<p>TV dovetails effectively with other mediums to produce a holistic, multidimensional campaign that captures customers wherever and however they’re consuming media. Research from Thinkbox asserts that outdoor, press, radio and online all experience increased response when coupled with an underlying TV advertising push. This grants TV advertisers with access to active, hard to reach audiences and broadens brand visibility considerably.</p>
